### <a name="How Mathematics Works"></a> How Mathematics Works

Mathematics operates through a systematic approach built on logic and defined rules. Key elements include:

1. Axioms and Postulates – Fundamental truths accepted without proof.  
2. Definitions – Precise meanings assigned to mathematical terms and objects.  
3. Theorems – Propositions proven based on axioms and previously established results.  
4. Proofs – Logical arguments that establish the truth of a theorem.  
5. Calculations – Step-by-step procedures to solve numerical or algebraic problems.  
6. Modeling – Using mathematical structures to represent real-world situations.
